<h1>UW UI Toolkit <small>{% uw_ui_toolkit_version %}</small></h1>

A web front-end toolkit based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for designing and developing modern, mobile-first websites for the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).

## What is it?

This toolkit, developed by [University Communications](http://uc.wisc.edu), sits on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), providing all its features and functionality, with UW-Madison’s look and feel layered on top.

## Who is it for?

This project is for employees at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who are designing and developing websites for official offices, programs and projects affiliated with the university. 

## A work in progress

We’re releasing this project into the wild early. As we go, look for more examples, more layout and designs and more documentation.
