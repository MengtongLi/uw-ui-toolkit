# UW UIToolkit

A web front-end toolkit based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for designing and developing modern, mobile-first websites for the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).

## What is it?

This toolkit, developed by [University Communications](http://uc.wisc.edu), sits on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), providing all its features and functionality, with UW-Madison’s look and feel layered on top.

## Who is it for?

This project is for staff at UW–Madison who are designing and developing websites for official offices, programs and projects affiliated with the university.

**Whether you are a novice or advanced web developer**, you'll find this toolkit useful.

If you just need the CSS files to include in your web project, visit our [downloads page]().

If you want to integrate the toolkit into your development environment, check out the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/UWMadisonUcomm/uw-ui-toolkit). We’re also interested in others helping improve this toolkit. So fork it and submit a pull request if you see something that can be made better!

## A work in progress

We’re releasing this project into the wild early. As we go, look for more examples, more layouts and designs, and more documentation.

And please [let us know what you think](mailto:webteam@uc.wisc.edu).
